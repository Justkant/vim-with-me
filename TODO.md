BEFORE DOOM ASCII
* brightness -> ascii tree for doom
* open command to tell the front-end how big
* fly.io relay
  - store open command
  - store ascii tree
  - default "nothing to see here" frame
* ui to display out the buffer
  - brightness -> ascii replay
* framing of data

TODO AFTER DOOM ASCII
* Virtual Boxes should not need a buffer reference
  - but they are iterators... can we fix this?
* 2 byte encoding
